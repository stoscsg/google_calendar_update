Fortieth day of Great Lent,4/7/2022,2022-04-07,,Thu,19:00,Matthew 4:1-11,"Of all the types and shadows of the Old Testament, none is as pervasive and important as the shadows revealed in the relationship between ""forty"" and the fulfillment of promises.The number forty is used by God to represent a period of testing or judgment (the length of time necessary to accomplish some major part of Gods plan in his dealings with various portions of mankind). The 40 days of rain in the days of the flood were the judgments of God. The 40 day periods of fasting, testing, and communing with God that were faced by Moses and Jesus were a form of God's judgments. The forty years that the Israelites spent in the wilderness were also the judgments of God. Various leaders in Israel who reigned for 40 year periods were put there by God according to His Will and Judgments.
We all have done our 40 days Noyambu (lent) to rejuvenate the holy spirit, now we walk with master the God, with his strength, with his power and with truth. hence, it's worth enough to us to reminiscence the Hosanna to Resurrection of Jesus the Savior."
