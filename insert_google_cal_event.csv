Kohane - Commemoration of all Departed Priests,2/13/2022,13/2/2022,,Sun,08:45,Matthew 24:42-51,"A special day to remember all the departed priest"
Anidhe - Commemoration of all Departed Faithful,2/20/2022,20/2/2022,,Sun,08:45,Luke 12:32-48,"The Sunday before the Great Lent is known as Anide (meaning-departed) Sunday. On this Sunday, the faithful follow the tradition of giving the names of their dear departed ones in writing to be remembered at the Altar, and visiting their graves. These names are remembered by the priest (5 times) at the altar during the Holy Qurbana, in a manner similar to how Moses & Aaron remembered the departed tribes of Israel by carving and carrying their names on stone tablets. ( Exodus 28: 9 - 12). It is also similar to how Judas Maccabeus and the Jews remembered and prayed for the departed & their sins, and looked forward to their resurrection (2 Mac.12: 38 - 45). \nThe liturgical hymn - Grant Rest 0 lord unto them (Karthave Nalkaashwaasam) of the 3rd Qauma of the Night Vigil (Raathri Namaskaram) exhorts and reminds the faithful to give in writing the names of the departed to be remembered in every Holy Eucharist Remembering the departed is a frequent theme in all the liturgies of the Orthodox Church. Thus, on this (Anide) Sunday, the blessings of the departed faithful is sought by praying at their graves and seeking their intercession, so that the faithful may be steadfast in their faith and tradition, and start the Lenten journey to overcome evil.\nThe Old Testament readings of the day throw light on how homage is paid to the departed (Jacob and Moses). However, the New Testament readings emphasize on the need to be humble and faithful, also focusing on the impermanence of human life."\n"Kothine (Pethurtha, Wedding Feast at Cana) | Feast of St. Geevarghese Mar Dionysius Vattasseril",2/27/2022,27/2/2022,,Sun,08:45,John 2:1-11,After knowing the nature of the Holy Trinity through the Season of Denaha (revelation), the Malankara Orthodox Church moves into the Season of Great Lent (third season of the liturgical cycle) to experience the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ while in the flesh.\nThe Church prescribes reading the passage that commemorates the Wedding at Cana from the gospel of St. John (2:1-11), to begin the Great Lent. Rather than using the word miracles, St. John describes this as the beginning of signs performed by Jesus (This denotes that the current occurrence is just a foretaste of a greater truth of the Resurrection that is yet to be experienced). Throughout the Great Lent, the Church commemorates such signs to prepare for the greatest of all occurrences - His Resurrection.\nJesus hereby begins His ministry at Galilee, which had a large Gentile population. Thus, this occasion affirms that the Gospel is meant for all sects of people, and lays an emphasis on the inclusive approach that needs to be adopted within the Church.\nThough Jesus is partially misinterpreted for calling His mother "Woman", His' high regard for His mother and the importance of intercession to her (Theotokos) are also made clear through this Gospel portion. Contrary to the certain modern usages, Woman' is a sacred title in the Scripture, an address conveying deep respect and distinction (Compare Gen 2:23, St. John 4: 21, 8: 10,19: 26,20: 13; Study notes from OSB- St. John 2:3-5).\nCana is called by its other name 'Koth'ne' in the Syriac Bible. Therefore, this Sunday is called Koth'ne Sunday. This Sunday is also the Pethurtha of the Great Lent. The word 'pethurtho' comes from the Syriac root 'ptr' which means 'go away' or 'return from (a banquet). Thus, Pethurtha marks an end to the feasting of 'pathinettida' (18 day period) and the beginning of the Great Lent (through the Service of Shubkono).",

Mid Lent,3/22/2022,22/3/2022,,Tue,19:00,John 3:13-21,"The 25th day of the lent which is always a Wednesday is known as mid lent. This is one of the very few days during the great lent when the Holy Qurbana is celebrated on a weekday other than Sunday or Saturday. On this day there is a procession around the church carrying the cross. This is followed by an exaltation of the cross (sleeba aaghosham) facing the four directions; East , West , North and South. Then the cross is placed on a big decorated cross like stand covered with a red cloth (Gogultha) in the middle of the the church. This remains in the church till the Feast of Ascension of our Lord which occurs 40 days after the Kyomtha (Feast of the Resurrection i.e. Easter).\nThe Holy Cross of Our LORD JESUS CHRIST (Golgotha) will be erected at the middle of the Church in remembrance of the lifting of the bronze serpent by Moses in the middle of the Israelite tents. It also symbolizes the Holy Cross erected at Calvary on which JESUS was lifted & crucified thereby Redeeming us from the slavery of sin.",

Fortieth day of Great Lent,4/7/2022,7/4/2022,,Thu,19:00,Matthew 4:1-11,"Of all the types and shadows of the Old Testament, none is as pervasive and important as the shadows revealed in the relationship between ""forty"" and the fulfillment of promises.The number forty is used by God to represent a period of testing or judgment (the length of time necessary to accomplish some major part of Gods plan in his dealings with various portions of mankind). The 40 days of rain in the days of the flood were the judgments of God. The 40 day periods of fasting, testing, and communing with God that were faced by Moses and Jesus were a form of God's judgments. The forty years that the Israelites spent in the wilderness were also the judgments of God. Various leaders in Israel who reigned for 40 year periods were put there by God according to His Will and Judgments.\nWe all have done our 40 days Noyambu (lent) to rejuvenate the holy spirit, now we walk with master the God, with his strength, with his power and with truth. hence, it's worth enough to us to reminiscence the Hosanna to Resurrection of Jesus the Savior.",
Saturday before Hosanna (Lazarus' Saturday),4/9/2022,9/4/2022,,Sat,07:30,John 11:28-46,"On this Saturday we remember how our Lord Jesus Christ raised His friend Lazarus from the dead. He knew Lazarus was grievously ill, but He waited till he died before He answered Martha and Mary's call for Him. Only after four days did He bring Lazarus back to life, so that His disciples would see.\nHe had power over life and death and was indeed "the Resurrection and the Life." It was this miracle that prepared the way for Christ's triumphant entry into Jerusalem and gave us the certain assurance of the physical resurrection of all the dead. Lazarus and his sisters Martha and Mary, the friends of Jesus, had given Him hospitality and served Him many times (Luke 10:38-42; John 12:23). They were from Bethany, a village of Judea. He asked, "Where have ye laid him?" and He wept over him. When He drew nigh to the tomb, He commanded that they remove the stone, and He lifted up His eyes, and giving thanks to God the Father, He cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth." And he that had been dead for four days came forth immediately, bound hand and foot with the grave clothes, and Jesus said to those standing there, "Loose him, and let him go." This is the supernatural wonder wrought by the Saviour that we remember on this day. In Malankara, we call this day as 'Kozhukkatta Perunnal'.",

Hosanna - Palm Sunday (Boys & Girls Day),4/10/2022,10/4/2022,,Sun,08:45,John 12:12-19,"The seventh Sunday of the Great Lent is known as Hosanna Sunday (or Palm Sunday). On this day, the Malankara Orthodox Church commemorates the triumphant entry of Christ into Jerusalem on a colt. All believers (like the Jews then) come together to celebrate the arrival of the Messiah, by offering flowers & palm leaves and by shouting praises with hymns of 'Hosanna' (Save us O Lord).\nThe themes of this day include:\n(1) the receiving the Messiah who has come triumphantly to 'Save us'; (2) praying for the biosphere (The liturgical calendar is set in tune with the seasonal variations in nature. Here, there are prayers for living organisms)\n(3) To imbibe the virtues of 'humility. The (evening) Sedro prayer of Hosanna Tuesday (38th day of Lent) proclaims this 'Instead of the Chariot of Cherubim, which carry You, Your Father, and Your Holy Spirit, Your grace humbled Yourself to take a wretched colt of donkey for your ride on this earth. By this You suppressed the pride of the devils and the demons.'\nHighlights of the order of Services:\n• All offices of prayers (namaskarams) which include petitions of Hosanna.\n• Reading of the Gospel 6 times ceremonially with hymns and showering of flowers\n• Procession with palm leaves commemorating Messiah's triumphant entry (to Jerusalem)\n• Blessing of palm leaves.\n• Exaltation of the Cross.\n• Holy Eucharist.\n,The Altar, Mnortho, Evangelion table and other sacred spaces of the Church are decorated with the blessed palm leaves. The faithful may take these palm leaves (to their homes, workplaces, granaries, farms, etc.) as a sign of blessing, and return them on the Feast of Nativity (Yeldho Perunnal) when it is offered in the Service by Fireside.\nThe celebration of Holy Eucharist on Hosanna also signifies the beginning of the passion week'. After the Hosanna services, the colourful veil, chitola, Golgotha gets a black attire and the mood is set sombre to indicate the forthcoming passion of our lord.\nLet us shout out 'O Lord, Son of David - Hosanna!'"
